## In class

## Skills homework and reading due Tuesday

We could spend the rest of the semester becoming Excel nerds, but this week marks the last skill that you'll have to master using spreadsheets. And it marks the moment when you can care more about words than numbers.

* [Review the tidy data and data types tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/excel-tidydata) and make sure you've understood what it is driving at. Post questions on Slack if you want some clarification.

* [Review this Group By tutorial](https://github.com/datajtext/DataJournalismTextbook/blob/master/Modules/GroupBy/group_by_with_excel.md), and follow along [using this dataset](https://github.com/datajtext/DataJournalismTextbook/blob/master/Data/mountainlions.csv?raw=true) (NOTE: This dataset is in a "csv" format. We'll talk about that next week, but for now it's ok to just double-click on the file icon. Use your right mouse button on the link and Save File As... to save it, or click on the link and save it on computer as mountainlion.csv)

* Watch this old version of a pivot table tutorial video, based on [this spreadsheet containing the salaries of major league baseball players]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/MLB2011.xlsx). It's not exactly the same as what you'll see today, but the ideas are the same. (Excuse my confusion over designated hitters in the American League...):

Follow along with it, and see if you can recreate the end result:
