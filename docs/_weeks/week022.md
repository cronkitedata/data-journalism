<!--
Put Google doc here if I want to have them test themselves on tidy data.

## Preparation

#### Tutorials

* [Group By tutorial](https://github.com/datajtext/DataJournalismTextbook/blob/master/Modules/GroupBy/group_by_with_excel.md), and follow along [using this dataset]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/data/xlexamples/mountainlions.xlsx) (NOTE: I converted Matt's original dataset into Excel -- we haven't gotten to data file types yet. We'll get there right after the test.). Make sure to look at the video embedded in the middle to walk you through it. )

* [Pivot tables with baseball stats]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/practice/12-excel-baseball). Try doing this tutorial with a newer dataset of the 2019 season that might be a little easier to understand, since the record wasn't as even in wins versus losses.

### Reading

* [Philandro Castile's Last Night: Tacos and Laughs, then a Drive](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/philando-castile-minnesota-police-shooting.html),  the New York Times, Mitch Smith with contribution from Robert Gebeloff, July 12, 2016. Look for how the data on police stops is used in the middle of the story. I'll demonstrate this one in class.
