> Write a letter to your future self so it doesn't hate your present self.

## Assignments due:

Sunday, Jan. 19: Finding stories in Arizona Census data: [exercise]() \| [data](), with data diary, on Canvas.

## In class

* Ethics and accuracy in data journalism part one
* Introducing the data diary
* Understanding data types: numbers, dates and text
* Lab: Calculating speeds from dates and times using 25,000 of the Sun-Sentinel's 72,000 records ([data file]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/data/xlexamples/cops-transponders.xlsx) \| [source](http://databases.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/ftlaudCopSpeeds/ftlaudCopSpeeds_list.php) )

Keep a copy of this dataset when we're done -- we're going to come back to it next week.

## Preparation

* Read Mike Berens (now of Reuters) on the [heart of data journalism]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/docs/berens_nerds_words.pdf), written in 1999, excerpt from Poynter's "[When Nerds and Words Collide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qw60af018wh1bkf/nerds-and-words.pdf?dl=0)" (reproduced with permission).

* Watch this video on understanding data types - we'll go back over it together.

* Review Part 1 of the Sun-Sentinel's award-winning project on speeding cops: "[Cops among Florida's worst Speeders, Sun-Sentinel Investigation Finds](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/fl-speeding-cops-20120211-story.html)", by Sally Kestin and John Maines, Feb. 11, 2012 (2013 Pulitzer Prize winner). I understand this is a bit long -- read enough of it to understand what they did and how they found it, as well as why data types matter. We'll be using a portion of this data in class.

### On ethics and accuracy:

We'll be revisiting accuracy and bulletproofing your work later in the semester, but these should get you started on some of the particular ethical challenges of empirical reporting.

* "[Challenges of Data Journalism](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/strategy-studies/data-journalism/single-page/#challenges-of-data-journalism)" section from Diving into Data Journalism by Samantha Sunne, American Press Institute, 2016
* [Replication and the data diary]({{site.cdocs}}/general/04-data-diary)
    * An [example data diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EzjZYKmr8u5QIIDEmVKCtyzlzie06VMyFRa2RRqmiT0/edit?usp=sharing). (I updated some of the links, but the data description is actually from 2017)
    * An [example data diary]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/docs/xl-mathreview-datadiary) from the budget exercise that goes through what was done before you got it.

OPTIONAL:

Slides from the 2017 NICAR conference on [ethics in data journalism](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fuGLuCeU84pk1u-ByncKAr-YUC9-0itlYuHf-dUiMY4/), Mary Jo Webster (Minneapolis Star Tribune) and Tom McGinty (Wall Street Journal). Much of this is about accuracy and context, but there are good items on scraping and terms of service, which are important to us.
