## Homework from Google training

The Google News training was heavy on Google tools, and very light on other tools that are commonly used in open source intelligence, or OSINT. Journalists are increasingly borrowing methods from that community.

Before Tuesday, you should review [This handout from Bellingcat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BfLPJpRtyq4RFtHJoNpvWQjmGnyVkfE2HYoICKOGguA/edit), which calls itself "the home of online investigations".

You should also look through the [Bellingcat web site](https://www.bellingcat.com/)'s guides, case studies and articles (linked on the top of the page) and pick one that you would like to share with the class.

Bring that and your reaction to the Google News training to class.

If you're interested in the field, I suggest you look through the Twitter feed of [Henk Van Ess](https://twitter.com/henkvaness), an international trainer for Bellingcat and Poynter, who specializes in social media spycraft.


## Scraping

We're going to start on web scraping on Tuesday, but you don't have to do a lot of preparation for that. We'll work off of the tutorial on "[Getting data from the web - part one]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/scrape-simple)" on this site.

[Here's the tutorial they used](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQQDa8-Lf9j-JxetKcbOdWl-IQWXgPVwDbq6rUsgkdM/edit) in the Google News training, though it doesn't explain much. I'll explain in class.

## Tuesday
* Discussion of what you found in Google News session and on Bellingcat. Everyone should expect to participate in this.

* Finding hidden data on the Web.

## Thursday

* Write your public records request.
* Discussion of grad student story reviews.
