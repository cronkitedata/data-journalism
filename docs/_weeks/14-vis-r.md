## Skills training - visualization

We talked about visualization as a reporting tool. [Here's a copy of the presentation]({{base.url}}/assets/docs/reportingviz_2018.pdf) from class. Your reading on the topic is from Alberto Cairo, one of the most active and well respected academics working in journalism visualizations. Understanding how viz can serve you is an important element of starting to use it.

Cairo has made available the tutorials and videos from a MOOC he taught last summer. The software he uses is called InZight, which is made by the same people who make RStudio.

* Go through the first two Modules -- [Introduction to Visualization Principles](https://journalismcourses.org/data-viz-course-material.html) and [Visualization to Find Stories in Data](https://journalismcourses.org/data-viz-course-material.html)

Expect to spend about 4 hours on this, and expect a quiz during the week on the contents of the course material.  NOTE: You don't have to learn to use the InZight program -- you won't be expected to. Instead, focus on the concepts and the process of exploration. It can be used in any program.

Optional: Go through Cairo's book "The Functional Art", [first three chapters](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/about-book.html) available for free online.

* Look at these two graphics and think about how they are represented:
  * "[A Wall Street Watchdog's Lighter Touch](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/trump-sec-doj-corporate-penalties.html)," New York Times, Nov. 3, 2018. (Scroll down to see the graphics)

  * "[How Democrats Took the House](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/07/us/politics/how-democrats-took-the-house.html)", a visual story by The New York TImes, Nov. 7, 2018. Look at the more modern storytelling technique: a story unfolds visually, rather than having more interactive graphics. This is becoming more common.



QUIZ:

Looking at the New York Times' Wall Street graphic:
1. What are the visual encodings?
2. Describe how it meets or fails to meet one of Cairo's core principles?

From the videos and presentations:
3. What set of data did Cairo use for his example in exploring data using visualization?

## Tuesday

R review with R Notebook; quiz on visualization videos / reading.

Here's a link to what we'll use in class. Just copy the link, don't open it.

## Thursday

Two extras in R, which will not be on the exam:

1. How to think about reshaping and cleaning a dataset, [using the Excel file](http://www.wrapsnet.org/admissions-and-arrivals/) that Phanindra is using in his project. (Choose the link for "Refugee Admissions Report October 31, 2018")

2. A simple walkthrough of charts in R, using a canned dataset that we can use as a package.

Your exam is posted on Blackboard. Please fill out the questions in the R Notebooks and upload them. They are due at the end of class next Tuesday. You can come to class to talk through any problems with it, but I won't help you outside of the class. This should not take more than an hour or two.

## Friday

If you want to have feedback on two drafts before the final, the first one is due on Friday. If you only want feedback on one, it can be turned in anytime between now and Nov. 25.
