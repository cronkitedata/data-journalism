## In class

* Joining in R
* Calculating new information from old in R

If there's time, I'll introduce you to your dataset choices for the memo project, and we'll go over some details on importing data that doesn't behave well.  If not, we'll do that next week.

**Thursday, Feb. 27: Guest speaker, Pamela Ren Larsen of The Arizona Republic.** Be sure to do the reading of her work below so you can ask good questions.

## Due this week

## Preparation
I'll post this by the end of the week.
