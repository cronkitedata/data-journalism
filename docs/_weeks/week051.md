## In class



## Due this week

* The R Markdown exercise at the end of that chapter in the [R Study Guide]({{site.rdocs}}). See how far you can get. Don't spend more than 1 hour on it.
(Some folks may be able to do it more quickly.) [Here's mine](...) as a zipped R Studio project. Unzip and then open the project in R Studio.

* Write out an algorithm for something you do all the time. This isn't programmed in a language -- just write down all the steps. Include a few decision points, such as the "check ingredients" in our example from last week. It can be as simple as making coffee or brushing your teeth.


## Preparation

### Skills

* A [gentle introduction to programming]({{site.rdocs}}/A02-programming) and coding. This just reviews what we were doing in class on Thursday. You might not need it.
* First two chapters of the [R Study Guide]({{site.rdocs}}): "An R and R Studio Tour" and "R Markdown"
* Take the first swirl() lesson (under Excercises in the reading).

### Reading

* Todd Wallack from the Boston Globe on using a little programming to get to a story on liquor licensing. Be sure to [read the story](https://t.co/6DuYIGp67u) to understand how the data fits in with the story. (2018)

* Five-Thirty-Eight: [Russian troll analysis on Twitter](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/?ex_cid=538twitter). Note the references to the original data, how it was collected, and the name of the project at Clemson. Even if you don't care about Russian trolls, it's worth noting these kinds of resources for the future -- these are the kinds of hints that will lead you to data for your own work.

* Two takes on racial disparities in traffic stops:
    * [Analysis: LAPD searches blacks and Latinos more.](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-searches-20190605-story.html), Ben Poston and Cindy Chan, Los Angeles Times, October 2019
    * [The disproportionate risk of driving while black](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html), Sharon LaFraniere and Andrew W. Lehren. Sharon has a really graceful way of writing about data.
