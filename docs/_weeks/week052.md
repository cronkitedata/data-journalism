## In class

### Thursday

* Introducing data frames, importing and viewing data with R.
* Story workshop on disparities in traffic stops


## Due this week

* If you didn't do it during the reading, do the exercise at the bottom of the  [R Study Guide Chapter 3: Data Frames and the Tidyverse]({{site.rdocs}}/022-data-frames).  This is the NEA data that you've seen before.  You don't need to turn anything in. 

## Preparation

### Skills

We'll go through in class the skills part, but if you want to read ahead:

* [R Study Guide Chapter 3: Data Frames and the Tidyverse]({{site.rdocs}}/022-data-frames)

### Reading

* Two takes on racial disparities in traffic stops:
    * [Analysis: LAPD searches blacks and Latinos more.](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-searches-20190605-story.html), Ben Poston and Cindy Chan, Los Angeles Times, October 2019
    * [The disproportionate risk of driving while black](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html), Sharon LaFraniere and Andrew W. Lehren. Sharon has a really graceful way of writing about data.
