Beginning this week, I'll start adding additional tutorials and resources at the bottom of each page for people who feel like they'd like to go further than what we'll get to in class. There is absolutely NO expectation that you'll do this.  It's only there if you want it.

## In class

### Tuesday

* Filtering in R: We'll quickly move through the NEA data, but then take on the Murder Accountability Project.

### Thursday

* Grouping and summarising in R: Same idea: Replicate your work on the NEA data, then take on something new.

You'll turn in a group lab on the murder data at the end of class Thursday.

## Due this week

Nothing except the lab. Take this time to carefully go through all of the material in R until you're comfortable with it.  If you have a "eureka!" moment, post it to Slack in the new #wins channel. If you need help, post it in #sos using the principles of asking good questions.

## Preparation

### Skills

Try to follow along with the examples in the chapters, but you don't have to do the exercises unless they're assigned. We'll work on the murder data from the filtering chapter in class. (I will post the data for the vaccinations and show you how to load it into R by Friday.)

* [R Study Guide](https://cronkitedata.github.io/rstudyguide/030-intro-verbs) chapters 5.1-5.3:
  * A quick tour of verbs
  * Verbs Part 1: Picking and choosing (for Tuesday)
  * Verbs Part 2: group_by and summarise (for Thursday)
