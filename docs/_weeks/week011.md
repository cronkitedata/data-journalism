I'll use this structure to lay out the outline for each week, key deadlines and homework, reading and other preparation. Keep an eye on the outline when you're doing your work so you know WHY I've assigned it.

## Assignments due this week:

* Tuesday: [Survey of skills and interests](https://forms.gle/JKeTkXzCE7zUqFDG6). NOTE: You must be logged into Google using your ASU account to get access to the survey.
* Friday: Complete the Cronkite Academic Integrity pledge in Canvas.


## In class

*  Introductions - you and me
*  Review of surveys and goals for the semester
*  Review of boot camp sessions
*  Lab: An Excel reboot using a city budget, to be submitted in Canvas at the end of class ([data file]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/data/xlexamples/phx_budget_summary.xlsx/) \| [tutorial]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-formulas) )

## Preparation

* [Read the syllabus in its entirety]({{"syllabus" | relative_url}}) and review the list of topics in the [schedule]({{ "schedule" | relative_url}}) a review of the topics listed by week.

* Look through the [Excel refresher]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-refresher) tutorial. I've found that almost everyone has used Excel or Google Sheets at least a little.  We'll start where this tutorial leaves off. You're not expected to come in with anything more.

* Review the boot camp sessions we did in the fall:

    * Numbers in the Newsroom: If [reviewing the slides]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/docs/numbers-in-the-newsroom-16.pdf)  still leaves you uncomfortable, look on Canvas for a free copy of my IRE beat book. I suggest reading the Introduction, Chapter 1, and the short sections from Chapter 2 on "Measuring Change", "The pers", and "Understanding averages". You can also review a [quick refresher on our course resources site]({{site.cdocs}}/general/03-newsroom-math).

    * Intro to Empirical Journalism and Public records: Refresh yourself by [glancing through the slides]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/docs/empirical-j-intro-bootcamp.pdf) again. If you want more on public records -- a crucial part of any data reporting -- I suggest buying [The Art of Access: Strategies for Acquiring Public Records](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Access-Strategies-Acquiring-Records/dp/1506380700/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/141-5195764-7429116), by David Cullier and Charles N. Davis. It's a quick read and has most of what you need.
