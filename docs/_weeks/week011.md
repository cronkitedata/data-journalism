I'll use this structure to lay out  1) class outlines, 2) key deadlines for this and the upcoming week, 3) Preparation required **before** class begins, including reading and tutorials.  Keep an eye on the outline when you're doing your work so you know why I've assigned it. Some weeks are combined into one document, others are not. See the [schedule]({{ "schedule" | relative_url }}) for the outline.

The weekly list of tasks under "Preparation" are shown in a suggested order.<br><br>
 Unless I suggest otherwise, you're expected to have done more than just skimmed through or reviewed the material. You should read, watch or listen closely and follow along on all of the tutorials. <br><br>I may ask for your copies of tutorials or give quizzes on the reading without warning. This helps me understand where the course is failing to meet its goals, but it only works if you've tried. Ask questions on the Slack #sos channel if you get stuck.

## Class outline

*  Introductions - you and me
*  Review of surveys and goals for the semester
*  Review of boot camp sessions
*  Lab: An Excel reboot using a city budget, to be submitted in Canvas at the end of class ([data file]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/data/xlexamples/phx_budget_summary.xlsx/) \| [tutorial]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-formulas) )

## Due this week

(Everything will be due in Canvas, unless it says otherwise.)

* Tuesday: [Survey of skills and interests](https://forms.gle/JKeTkXzCE7zUqFDG6) via Google docs. NOTE: You must be logged into Google using your ASU account to get access to the survey.
* Friday: Cronkite Academic Integrity pledge in Canvas
* Friday: Sign into the [Slack account for the class](https://asu-2201-mco510-30433.slack.com/) and join the #general, #sos, #stories channels as well as the channel for your section. I suggest downloading the app to your phone / laptop rather than counting on the browser version.  (There is also a link to the Slack channel on the name of this  course on your My ASU page.)
* Sunday, Jan. 19: [First homework]( {{"assignments/01-census" | relative_url}}) on spreadsheets in Canvas.

## Preparation

* [Syllabus]({{"syllabus" | relative_url}}) and [schedule]({{ "schedule" | relative_url}}).

* Look through the [Excel refresher]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-refresher) tutorial. I've found that almost everyone at least a passing familiarity with Excel or Google Sheets, but this will start us all at the same point.

* Review the boot camp sessions we did in the fall:

    * Numbers in the Newsroom: Start by [reviewing the slides]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/docs/numbers-in-the-newsroom-16.pdf). There is a copy of my beat book called "Numbers in the Newsroom" on Canvas under the Shared Resources module. If you're uncomfortable, take a quick cruise through it to see what's there for future reference.

    * Intro to Empirical Journalism and Public records: Refresh yourself by [glancing through the slides]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/docs/empirical-j-intro-bootcamp.pdf) again. If you want more on public records -- a crucial part of any data reporting -- I suggest buying [The Art of Access: Strategies for Acquiring Public Records](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Access-Strategies-Acquiring-Records/dp/1506380700/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/141-5195764-7429116), by David Cullier and Charles N. Davis. It's a quick read and has most of what you need.
