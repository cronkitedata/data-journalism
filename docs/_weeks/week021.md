## Preparation

* "[Take an Interviewing Approach to Find Stories in Data](http://mediashift.org/2014/07/take-an-interviewing-approach-to-find-stories-in-data/)", by Derek Willis, Mediashift, July 2014.
* "[What is a data state of mind](https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/what-is-a-data-state-of-mind-and-how-you-can-develop-it)? And how you can develop it," Mary Jo Webster, Data Driven Journalism, September 2016
* "[Demystifying Data Journalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nj0r_A0co)," Mashable Media Summit with Susan McGregor and Sarah Cohen, December 2012.

### Tutorials
* Look through the [filter and sort tutorial]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-filtersort) and read the accompanying story "[Police Chiefs, Looking to Diversify Forces, Face Structural Hurdles](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/us/politics/police-chiefs-looking-to-diversify-forces-face-structural-hurdles.html)," Matt Apuzzo and Sarah Cohen, Nov. 2015, The New York Times. We'll go through sorting and filtering in class. (If you really want it, here is a [copy of an early version of the spreadsheet]({{site.cdocs}}/assets/data/xlexamples/lemas2012_proportions.xlsx) we used to get to this story -- don't feel obliged to look at it.)



*If you'd like a different take on the skills*
* [Spreadsheets for Journalism](https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/spreadsheets-for-journalism), by Brant Houston, an excerpt from his new edition of the book, goes through the skills we've done so far. You might find a different approach to it useful if you're unsure.
