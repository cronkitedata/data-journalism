This week we'll start learning R.  I'll be learning with you.


## Skills homework

Do the first two sections [learn.r-journalism.com](http://learn.r-journalism.com/en/) site created by Andrew Ba Tran: "Getting Started" and "1. How to Use R" Don't worry too much if you have trouble understanding the "data structures" section. In programming languages, there are things other than numbers, words and dates -- there are also collections of items. The one we're going to use most of the time is the data frame, which is effectively a named tidy spreadsheet.

There are more resources under tutorials, ["Beginning with R"]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/r-basics).

## Tuesday
* R exercise in class

## Thursday
* More on R, and first exploration of potential data sets for your final project.
