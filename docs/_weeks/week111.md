## DRAFT - UPDATES TK


## Preparation

* Make sure you have a Facebook, Instagram and Twitter account. You can create one that you'll only use for reearch, and you won't be posting anything to the account.  I just use my own.

* Consider getting a Signal account if you don't have one already. We won't be using it much, but it's particularly useful in international investigations.

* View "[Anatomy of a Killing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbnLkc6r3yc)" from the BBC:

Before Tuesday, you should review [This handout from Bellingcat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BfLPJpRtyq4RFtHJoNpvWQjmGnyVkfE2HYoICKOGguA/edit), which calls itself "the home of online investigations".

You should also look through the [Bellingcat web site](https://www.bellingcat.com/)'s guides, case studies and articles (linked on the top of the page) and pick one that you would like to share with the class.

If you're interested in the field, I suggest you look through the Twitter feed of [Henk Van Ess](https://twitter.com/henkvaness), an international trainer for Bellingcat and Poynter, who specializes in social media spycraft.
