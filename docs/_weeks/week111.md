## Preparation

* Make sure you have a Facebook, Instagram and Twitter account. You can create one that you'll only use for reearch, and you won't be posting anything to the account.  I just use my own.

* Consider getting a Signal account if you don't have one already. We won't be using it much, but it's particularly useful in international investigations.

* View "[Anatomy of a Killing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbnLkc6r3yc)" from the BBC:
