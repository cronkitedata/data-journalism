## Preparation

* Review the [tidy data chapter]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-tidydata). (You've already looked at the data types part of it -- tidy data is halfway down.)

From now on, we'll be reading and viewing or listening to actual stories, usually three or four a week. Try to look at them like a writer, not a casual audience member. Try to think about:

* Where might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?
* What records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?  How  might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?
* Pick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controverial? How might they have been derived? What standards are they measuring against?
* What is the writing and presentation mechanism for the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study?
* Does the story broaden an already existing narrative or anecdote, or did it seem to start with a big idea? How did it evolve, and what questions were asked?
* Are you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn't get addressed?

This week's stories:

* The Boston Globe's Todd Wallack [tweetstorm on data journalism](https://twitter.com/TWallack/status/931175887269134336). Be sure to read the full story linked off of the tweet.
