## Due this week

* Sunday, Jan. 26: Filter and pivot table homework on Canvas
* Tuesday, Jan. 28: Optional -- take the practice quiz on Canvas testing yourself on tidy data principles.
* Thursday, Jan. 30: Choose one of the stories we don't go over in class and comment on a single element once your read or listen to it like a reporter and writer.

## In class

### Tuesday
* Understanding (and internalizing) tidy data principles
* Reading (and viewing) like a writer -- deconstructing long-form journalism to get from "do I like it?" to "How could I do it?" We'll go through one of the stories assigned together.

### Thursday

* Catch-up day and review for Excel exam. Bring your questions, comments and complaints to class.

## Preparation
(all for Tuesday)

### Tidy data

* Spend some time on the the [tidy data chapter]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-tidydata) of our web site. I'll post a self-assessment on Canvas so you can quiz yourself after you read it.

The idea of "tidy data" is among the most important concepts we'll cover this semester. Understanding the principles well will help you imagine how a dataset SHOULD look, and what you can do with it if it does. Bring questions and comments about it to class -- we'll be coming back to this regularly.

### Reading the data-driven story

From now on, we'll be reading and viewing or listening to actual stories, usually three or four a week. Try to look at them like a writer, not a casual audience member. Ask yourself:

* Where might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?
* What do you think came first -- a narrative single example that was broadened by data, or a big idea that was illustrated with characters?
* What records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?  How  might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?
* What methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won't always know, but look for a methodology section in each story.
* Pick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controverial? How might they have been derived? What standards are they measuring against? Have they given critics their due?
* How effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.
* Are you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn't get addressed?

This week's stories:

* APM Reports' podcast series ["In the Dark" Season 2, Episode 7](https://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark/season-two) on the many trials of Curtis Flowers was driven by data reporting by Will Craft, June 15, 2018.  (Scroll all the way past the latest developments to get a list of the episodes)

* "[Long Island Divided](https://projects.newsday.com/long-island/real-estate-agents-investigation/)", by Ann Choi, Bill Dedman, Keith Herbert and Olivia Winslow, Newsday. It's worth noting that Dedman was the lead author on the groundbreaking "Color of Money" story of 1989, which for the first time documented home mortgage redlining in Atlanta. There is also a video in the presentation on how they did the testing.

* "[L.A. is slammed with record costs for legal payouts](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-city-payouts-20180627-story.html)", Emily Alpert Reyes and Ben Welsh. You might not understand the Python programs [in this document](https://github.com/datadesk/la-settlements-analysis/blob/master/notebook.ipynb), but it will help show you what an exemplary data diary document might look like. It self-documents the project by providing sources and listing the questions they asked.
