## Preparation

* Review the [tidy data chapter]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-tidydata). (You've already looked at the data types part of it -- tidy data is halfway down.)

So far, much of your reading has been technical -- tutorials and how-tos. Now we're going to start adding journalism into the mix, including approaches to records and statistics that are peculiar to journalism, and stories that have been reported using records as a starting point:

* The Boston Globe's Todd Wallack [tweetstorm on data journalism](https://twitter.com/TWallack/status/931175887269134336). Be sure to read the full story linked off of the tweet.

* "[Even Critics of the saftey net increasingly Depend on It](http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html)", by Binyamin Applebaum and Robert Gebeloff, New York Time, February 2012. This is a good example of mashing up Census data on counties with other sources.

* "[Rural Aid Goes to Urban Areas]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/rural_development.pdf)", by Gilbert Gaul and Sarah Cohen. This is an example of using county typology codes mashed up with other data.
