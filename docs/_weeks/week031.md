## Preparation

* Review the [tidy data chapter]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/xlguides/xl-tidydata). (You've already looked at the data types part of it -- tidy data is halfway down.)

So far, much of your reading has been technical -- tutorials and how-tos. Now we're going to start adding journalism into the mix, including approaches to records and statistics that are peculiar to journalism, and stories that have been reported using records as a starting point:

GET RID OF SOME OF THESE.

* The Boston Globe's Todd Wallack [tweetstorm on data journalism](https://twitter.com/TWallack/status/931175887269134336). Be sure to read the full story linked off of the tweet.

* "[Even Critics of the saftey net increasingly Depend on It](http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html)", by Binyamin Applebaum and Robert Gebeloff, New York Time, February 2012. This is a good example of mashing up Census data on counties with other sources.

* "[Rural Aid Goes to Urban Areas]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/rural_development.pdf)", by Gilbert Gaul and Sarah Cohen. This is an example of using county typology codes mashed up with other data

* Boston Globe: "[For some State Police, it's a posting in Paradise](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/14/for-some-state-police-posting-paradise/OAQmtHaFtLZr0Mt8faPQKM/story.html)," by Kay Lazar and Todd Wallack. Be sure to [read Todd's tweetstorm](https://mobile.twitter.com/TWallack/status/1025346534471348225) on what it took to get this data, and how he got past bureaucratic and public records battles.

* "[The Serial-Killer Detector](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-serial-killer-detector)", The New Yorker, Nov. 27, 2017 about Tom Hargrove's career as a data reporter and how it led to the Murder Accountability Project

* "[L.A. is slammed with record costs for legal payouts](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-city-payouts-20180627-story.html)", Emily Alpert Reyes and Ben Welsh
