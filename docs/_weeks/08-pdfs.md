We'll spend time both days getting to the point where you can ask for data informally, with two weeks to negotiate for it before we write a final letter. All of your research will lead you to know:

* What agency holds the records
* What is publicly releasable.
* What fields you reasonably expect to be in the data.
* What the database or form is called.

## Tuesday

* Quick reading quiz
* Discussion of textbook reading
* Demo of various tools for converting PDFs to spreadsheets, and how you might approach the problem.

## Thursday

* Finish up what you need to request the records.  By the end of class, you should have a road map for requesting the records and have assigned somoene in your group to pursue them.
* At end of class: Notecard with a key takeaway from the first half of the semester. We'll talk about them on Thursday. It can be anonymous if you like.
