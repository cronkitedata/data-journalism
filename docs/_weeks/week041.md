## Due this week

Sunday, Feb. 9: 1st self-assessment on Canvas


## Tuesday

Your Excel exam will take up the whole period. It is open book, open Internet, open notes, etc. but it is to be done individually. You are not allowed to consult one another on it.

To get ready, read "[The Serial Killer Detector](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-serial-killer-detector)," the New Yorker, Nov. 27, 2017 about Tom Hargrove's career as a data reporter and how it led to the Murder Accountability Project. (It'll make sense when you see the test. )

## Thursday

Tentatively: Dealing with difficult formats and untidy data; PDF extraction; data cleaning with OpenRefine
Alternatively: A gentle introduction to programming.

Either way, you don't have anything to do to get ready.
