## In class

You've made it through the Excel sprint. If you've kept up, the exam will not be hard -- you've seen it all before.

Your Excel exam will take up the whole period. It is open book, open Internet, open notes, etc. but it is to be done individually. You are not allowed to consult one another on it.


### Prepare for the test

* Read "[The Serial Killer Detector](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-serial-killer-detector)," the New Yorker, Nov. 27, 2017 about Tom Hargrove's career as a data reporter and how it led to the Murder Accountability Project. (It'll make sense when you see the test. )

* Just go back through what you've already done. There won't be anything new.

### Some tips:

* Don't forget to read any documentation available on the data.
* Read the questions carefully. They're not intended to be trick questions, but there might be ways to misinterpret. Ask during class if there's any clarification needed.
* Spend as much time thinking about stories and newsworthiness as thinking about the technical aspects.
* Check your accuracy, especially in rounding and phrasing.

## Due this week

Sunday, Feb. 9: 1st self-assessment on Canvas

## Thursday

* Review of the Excel exam
* Let's talk stats! There are a couple of very short readings below.
* A [gentle introduction to programming]({{site.rdocs}}/A02-programming) and coding
* Lab (if there's time): Write your own algorithm.

### Stats reading

* [Statistician proves that statistics are boring](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistician-proves-that-statistics-are-boring-4fc22c95031b) . Notice the most important part here: that statistics assumes you don't have knowledge of every tree. Is that true in public records work?


* [Four years in a row, police nationwide fatally shoot nearly 1,000 people - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/four-years-in-a-row-police-nationwide-fatally-shoot-nearly-1000-people/2019/02/07/0cb3b098-020f-11e9-9122-82e98f91ee6f_story.html). How well did they describe uncertainty?

Market manipulation? [“There Is Definite Hanky-Panky Going On”: The Fantastically Profitable Mystery of the Trump Chaos Trades"](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-mystery-of-the-trump-chaos-trades), Vanity Fair. What else might he need to prove something more than coincidence?
