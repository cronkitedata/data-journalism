## Skills homework and reading

### Homemade databases

Here are several sets of tip sheets about how to build your own database. **You will need your IRE login to get to them.**

We're going to be a little more disciplined about this than the tipsheets suggest, but the ideas will be the same.

* "[Rolling your own data: Nuisance Abatements](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4840/)", tipsheet from Sarah Ryley.
* "[Build your own database](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3060/)", John Maines, tipsheet from 2008
* "[When Data Doesn't Exit](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4055/)", Sarah Cohen, a collection of stories done when reporters had to build their own databases.
* "[The Power of Building Your Own Database](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/1598/)," Sarah Cohen, David Heath and Anthony DeBarros.
* "[How We Built a Database from Thousands of Police Reports](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-we-built-database-thousands-police-reports/)", Mary Jo Webster, Source, Aug. 23, 2018.

### The end of Excel

This is the last week we'll be adding new Excel skills. You'll do it by working with a made-up dataset of cell phone calls presumably made and accepted by a city official. We'll do this together in class. In the meantime, though, review these tipsheets to get a sense of what other types of formulas are available for you to use:

Try these tips on any spreadsheet of your choice.
* Handout from  Jaimi Dowdell, IRE's former training director, on [formulas that reporters often use](https://github.com/sarahcnyt/data-journalism/blob/master/class3/Excelformulas.pdf).
* Mary Jo Webster's [Excel Magic handout](https://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/tipsheets/ExcelMagic.pdf)

### Other reading - getting ready for public records project

* Boston Globe: "[For some State Police, it's a posting in Paradise](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/14/for-some-state-police-posting-paradise/OAQmtHaFtLZr0Mt8faPQKM/story.html)," by Kay Lazar and Todd Wallack. Be sure to [read Todd's tweetstorm](https://mobile.twitter.com/TWallack/status/1025346534471348225) on what it took to get this data, and how he got past bureaucratic and public records battles.

* "[The Serial-Killer Detector](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-serial-killer-detector)", The New Yorker, Nov. 27, 2017 about Tom Hargrove's career as a data reporter and how it led to the Murder Accountability Project

* "[L.A. is slammed with record costs for legal payouts](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-city-payouts-20180627-story.html)", Emily Alpert Reyes and Ben Welsh


## Thursday

Sandhya had to cancel her appearance today, so we'll spend the day finishing up on Excel, and then working on practice exercises.

### Final Excel exercise - not turned in
We'll look at [cell phone records from a public official]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/xl-all-together).

### Practice data

If you want to practice on your own on fully explained exercises, the [IRE site has some VERY old exercises](https://ire.org/nicar/database-library/practice-data-sets/excel/) (many written by me in the 1990s) that may look different now, but are effectively the same. Look for ones that say there is a guide or a Q&A listed. That will help lead you through the data. (Some of the guides and Q&A's aren't matched up with the right datasets. Don't worry about it -- just go and look for a different one that might be useful for the skills you're trying to build.)


In class, we can practice with some of their datasets from the 2018 conference:

* [Homicides from 2014](https://www.dropbox.com/work/CAR18_Data/Excel_2_Using_Formulas_For_Stories_1110?preview=Homicide2014.xlsx), according to the FBI (rates and sorting)
* [Lottery winers from New York](https://www.dropbox.com/work/CAR18_Data/Excel_3_Pivot_tables_1111?preview=lotterywinners.xls) (pivot tables)

### Review for the test Tuesday

I expect that some of you will be able to finish the exam in class. Others will prefer to take it home. You may use whatever materials you want to complete it, but it must be an individual effort. You are NOT permitted to work together or consult one another on the test.  It will be due at 2pm on Blackboard on Wednesday, Sep. 19. Every hour after the deadline will result in one full grade reduction. For example, if you turn it in at 2:01pm, your highest possible grade is a B.  

Here's what you should expect:

You'll be presented with two or three datasets with documentation and links to the original sources. You are expected to read and understand enough about them to work with them. I suggest you start your data diary as soon as you start looking at the data.  

* A few short answer or multiple choice questions asking you to evaluate the structure of a proposed dataset. It won't be hard, but it will require that you review our discussions on "tidy data", [data types] and on the concepts of [creating your own dataset]. An [old video going through an example from the Jack Kevorkian case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-Px0AIxbRA&t=1056s) I mentioned in class is available on YouTube. [Here's the document](https://github.com/sarahcnyt/data-journalism/blob/master/class1/Kevorkian.pdf) if you want to follow along

* Calculate change, percent change, and percent of total. There won't be any math more difficult than adding, subtracting, and dividing.

* Calculate the sum, average and median of a list of values.

* Filter a dataset to count and find records you care about.

* Create a pivot table to summarize (group by) certain categories.

* Put all of these things together to come up with questions or story ideas suggested by the data.

You do not have to turn in your data diary, but I will ask to refer to it if I have questions about what you did in your data.
