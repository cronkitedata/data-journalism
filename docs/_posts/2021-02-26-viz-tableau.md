**NOTE** Be sure to sign up for an account with Tableau, either the [public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) version or the [student](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) Desktop version. If you plan to use your own computer for the work, be sure to install the software BEFORE class. All of the lab computers should have Tableau on them already.

You don't have to do anything over Spring Break other than to think about which of the three datasets I introduce in class on Wednesday you will want to work on for your story memo project.

#### Reading due Monday, Feb. 26
(From now on, I'll put reading on the day it's due rather than the day before)

On Monday, we're going to get started on data visualization as it's used in reporting, rather than for publication or presentation. The principles will be the same, but the polish won't.

* "Vizualization as a reporting tool":
(None of the links work on either the handout or the interview -- don't bother to try.)

  * An [interview with me](https://www.poynter.org/news/using-data-visualization-reporting-tool-can-reveal-storys-shape) from Poynter leading up to a conference
  * [The handout](../../assets/docs/viz-reporting-tool.pdf) from the conference
  * [The slides](../../assets/docs/viz-reporting-examples.pdf) that can provide the examples from the conference

* Chapter from the Data Journalism H\andbook on [finding insights through visualization](http://datajournalismhandbook.net/1.0/en/understanding_data_7.html), from Gregor Aisch, who is a longtime genius graphics reporter at the New York TImes.

* Review the slides from [Peter Aldhous's site](http://paldhous.github.io/ucsc/2016/investigative-policy/week5.html) on visualizing data for science investigations.

#### Due Tuesday, Feb. 27 6pm
A link to your Tableau Public workbook from the tutorial we start on Monday.

### In class

#### Monday
* Examples of visualization to help you find your story in time and place.
* We'll work through Peter Aldhous's [tutorial](http://paldhous.github.io/ucsc/2016/investigative-policy/week5.html) that is on the same page as his slides.

You don't have to stay for the whole class if you prefer to do this tutorial at home. But, like the exam, I won't be available to help you over speed bumps if you choose to skip that part of class.

 ### Recommended resource
 Financial Times' "visual vocabulary", as a [pdf](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/blob/master/visual-vocabulary/Visual-vocabulary.pdf) or [online](http://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/)

#### Wednesday
More visualization.
Introducing three datasets:
 * Fatal Accident Reporting System
 * Hazardous chemical spills
 * Federal campaign finance
