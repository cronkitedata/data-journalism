Beginning Tuesday, March 17, we'll transition to remote classes via Zoom. I'll be sending out more details on how this will work over the weekend, but for now:

* We will hold class at the normal time, and I expect everyone to show up via Zoom if at all possible.
* The university is not closing and computers/labs will still be available.
* And cross your fingers!
