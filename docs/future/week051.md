## In class




## Preparation

TAKE OUT SOME OF THESE:
* Intro and chapter 1, Sharon Machliss's book <http://www.machlis.com/R4Journalists/introduction.html>
* We already did intro to coding?
* Port this to the R textbook: <https://cronkitedata.github.io/cronkite-docs/r-stats/r-intro.html>
* Take the first swirl() lesson - don't worry about the red text, just read it. It's not an error. This is done in the console, but it gets you used to the idea of assigning variables and creating lists.




## Thursday

No preparation required

* Review of the Excel exam
* A [gentle introduction to programming]({{site.rdocs}}/00-programming.html) and coding
* Lab: Write your own algorithm! (We'll discuss in class, no need to turn it in.)
