Here are several sets of tip sheets about how to build your own database. **You will need an IRE login to get to them.**

We're going to be a little more disciplined about this than the tipsheets suggest, but the ideas will be the same.

* "[Rolling your own data: Nuisance Abatements](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4840/)", tipsheet from Sarah Ryley.
* "[Build your own database](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3060/)", John Maines, tipsheet from 2008
* "[When Data Doesn't Exit](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4055/)", Sarah Cohen, a collection of stories done when reporters had to build their own databases.
* "[The Power of Building Your Own Database](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/1598/)," Sarah Cohen, David Heath and Anthony DeBarros.
