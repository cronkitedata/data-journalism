We're going to start on web scraping on Tuesday, but you don't have to do a lot of preparation for that. We'll work off of the tutorial on "[Getting data from the web - part one]({{site.cdocs}}//special/scrape-part1)"

## Tuesday
* Looking behind the curtain at websites, and getting data from them (pt 1)
* Finding hidden data on the Web.

## Thursday

* More on data scraping
* Data hunt story idea workshop
