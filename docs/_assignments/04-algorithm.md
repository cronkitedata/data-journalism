This assignment is due {{page.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d"}}, based on the intro tor programming lecture and tutorial.

Write out an algorithm (like the one in class for making an omelet) for any ritual you perform in your own life. This can be something you do every day, something you do before you report a story, or the way you make a SnapChat. Keep it simple, but try to think through every step you take and explicitly write it down.

You don't need to format this as a program, but kudos if you can figure out how to do that.

We'll start this in class, and you'll finish it over the weekend.
