Do the [tutorial on working with Census data]({{site.cdocs}}/excel/practice/01-excel-azpop-exercise) from our course resources site. Turn in your final spreadsheet and data diary on Canvas by midnight Sunday.

Before you tackle it, try to take a look at a few daily stories that were done off of Census releases. Here are a few examples (not all of them from the exact same dataset that you have.):

*“[Georgia’s small towns continue to shrink]”, Jennifer Peebles, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 23, 2019
*“[Texas gained almost nine Hispanic residents for each additional white resident last year]”, Alexa Ura and Connie Hanzang Jin, The Texas Tribune, June 20, 2019.
*"[Arizona’s average age still below U.S., but it’s catching up fast](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2019/06/21/arizonas-average-age-still-below-u-s-but-its-catching-up-fast/), by Miranda Faulkner, Cronkite News

Notice how these authors found one theme to explore in a simple population release and stuck to those themes.  Think about other trends that might be interesting in a data set that include population changes, births, deaths and migration over time by county.
