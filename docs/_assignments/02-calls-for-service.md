This assignment is due {{page.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d"}}, based on the sorting, filtering and grouping that we've already done.

[Excel file]({{ site.cdocs}}/assets/data/xlexamples/calls_nov_2019.xlsx) \| [Source](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/calls-for-service/resource/1d536ee6-7ffb-49c3-bffe-5cdd98a3c97e)

The dataset is one week's worth of calls for service from the Phoenix police department extracted from the dataset published on its [open government site](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/calls-for-service/resource/1d536ee6-7ffb-49c3-bffe-5cdd98a3c97e). You should be sure to read the description of the data and the record layout before you try to do anything with it.  Don't forget to press "Show More" at the bottom of the page. I extracted just one week of calls and converted the date and time variables to make them a little easier to work with.

Using this dataset, you should

* Interview the data. There are some questions that just can't be answered from this dataset, and others that can. Think about its strengths and weaknesses.
* Using the data, construct three questions and answers that are do-able with this data; construct one question that would require more or different data.

In this case, you can work together if you'd like to come up with good questions, but please make sure that coming up with the answers is done individually. Credit anyone you work with who came up with a great question.

Turn in your questions and answers in Canvas.

### Grids

Understanding the grids will will help you if you want to narrow your work to one neighborhood or area using filters or find high-crime areas. I have inquired about getting an electronic copy of the grid map, but for now think of it as a checkerboard overlaid on top of Phoenix.

For reference, the grids are shown online on the crime map at https://communitycrimemap.com . Look on the left side of the screen, expand the "Agency Layers" arrow, and click on the grids. Generally, they are made up of two parts -- two letters, running South to North (generally), and two numbers, running West to East.:

* From West to East they run from 01 through 42. The last one (42) is right up against Scottsdale. Central Ave. is the border between 27 and 28.
* From North to South they're more confusing. Around South Mountain, they start at AB and move north to AC, AD through AJ, then BA through BF, etc. The northernmost grid is in the H's. But going south from around South Mountain, they start at IA, and go UP, to IB, IC, etc.

For reference, ASU's downtown campus is at BB28. That grid runs from Van Buren to Roosevelt and Central Avenue to 7th Street.
