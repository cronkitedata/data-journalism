This project makes up 15 percent of your final grade. It involves analyzing a dataset that contains records that would be of interest to a story or feature.

Key deadlines:

* March 1: A one-paragraph proposal with your dataset choice and a very brief description of what you hope to do with it.
* March 29: An optional draft of your memo, with your documentation
* April 4: Final story memo with documentation

## Choosing a dataset

I've tried having people find their own data in the past, but it's harder than it sounds to find one that's right for this project. I'm happy to add options to this list if you have ideas --  let me know by the end of January if you have a good candidate.

Here's a preliminary list of datasets:

* H1B Visa applications, from the US Labor Department
* Measles vaccinations rates for all Arizona schools
* A campaign finance dataset that I haven't settled on yet
* Immigration status inquiries made to ICE by Arizona State troopers, from an ACLU records request.
* Air pollution records for Maricopa County
* A collection of tweets posted by Joe Arpao, the candidate and former Maricopa County sheriff, collected in a Workbench recipe for the past year.

## The memo

The final memo can take several forms, but most will be traditional story pitches of about 1,000 words. They should include:

* A nut graf or lede that clearly relates the theme of the story and the results of your analysis so far.
* Examples of places, people, or other anecdotes derived from the data that illustrate the story
* A description of the analysis and research you've done so far, and
* A detailed description of the reporting that is left to do before you can finish the story (including document requests and street reporting).

Your story memo doesn't have to result in a pitch for a typical "numbers" story.  It can be a story that was derived from the data but has no numbers, such as a narrative about a person or place you found in the data. It can be an infographic or a visual story of some kind. Or it can be a more traditional investigative piece.


### Final deliverables
* The memo itself
* All documentation needed to get from the dataset provided to your to your end product. In R, this can be written into your R Markdown document, which is why I strongly prefer that you do your analysis that way.
* If necessary, a copy of any additional data you used in your project, such as Census files.

## Grading
Your work will be graded based on:

* Your story idea and the quality of your written memo.
* The skill and imagination you showed in teasing out crucial details and facts from your data.
* The research and reporting you did to understand the promise and pitfalls of your data as it relates to your idea.
* Accuracy in your data analysis and your characterization of it. 
* How well you took direction during the project.
* Your methodology and documentation documents.
