## Empirical reporting

### Walter Cronkite School of Journalism

This is the website for the data journalism course for the Cronkite school.

For Spring 2020, the classes that are included here are:
  * MCO 510: Data Journalism, for Masters' of Mass Communication,
  * MCO 510: Data Journalism, for Masters' of Investigative Journalism


It's not the ideal course name, since no one really knows what it means. For now, we'll call it "Empirical Journalism", and work from there.

Important updates will be shown on this home page, but be sure to allow for Slack notifications -- you'll hear everything there first.
