Most assignments will be the same for both sections of the course. Some of this will change later in the semester to make it less repetitive for those in the interdisciplinary courses for the MIJ degree.

This lists assignments that should be turned in via your Canvas site. Other requirements are shown on each week's page, including reading and preparation due each day. Be sure to check the [weekly pages]({{ "/weeks" | relative_url}}) well before the class date.
