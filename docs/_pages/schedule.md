Here is a preliminary schedule with key deadlines. You will usually have something due every week beyond these bigger assignments, either as a lab or as homework. Be sure to check the detail page of each week for specifics. Everything is shown in the week that it's due, with the week beginning on Tuesday. Beginning around Spring Break, these routine homework assignments will become less frequent as you start concentrating on the longer-term work.

Try not to leave your explainer assignment until the last minute. It'll make your final week of class even more difficult than usual, and it's designed so that you can create your explainer any time you find something interesting.

When a deadline is shown for a class day, it means it's due before class starts.
