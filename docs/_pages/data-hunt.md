Preliminary due date: Sunday, April 12.

I'll flesh this out more later in the semester, but the basic idea is to come up with a story idea and then identify possible datasets and sources that can be used to find examples, document trends or compare real life against the rules or officials' promises.

As you move through the semester, think about stories that you'd like to do in the future. This assignment gives you a chance to do early prospecting on a story  -- a luxury you won't often have in a newsroom.  Run the story idea by me before you get too far along either in person or in an email / Slack message.

You may want to review the tutorial on [finding data sources]({{site.cdocs}}/general/02-sourcing) for ideas on how to find datasets. The approach we will use is one that many reporters use when they start on longer term projects: [reporting from the outside in]({{site.cdocs}}/foia/public-records-outside-in)

You'll turn in your story idea and three possible public records sources that you would use or combine in order to document the story.
